## CODER'S NOTE

** This assignment is far from being complete, but I have run into many bugs/roadblocks and am out of time. I was told that turning in something incomplete and ontime is better than turning in something late because I can always come back and complete it. The tables, seed data, and prompts with recursion run fine, but there is a bug when calling the tables through the prompts I've made. I also didn't have time to get to the add prompts up and running.**

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Description

This is a command line application that utilizes inquirer and mySQL to create a dynamic database that can be displayed as tables and edited/modified from the command line. I have set up inquirer prompts with recursion to make a menu system that would allow a user to add, edit or delete employees, roles, and departments, with all the sub attributes that those tables contain.

## Usage

1. Open your command interface
2. Download all necessary add-ons and open all .sql files to update the tables (if this hasn't already been done)
3. Use the menu in the command line to manipulate the tables as needed
4. When finished, select the QUIT option
